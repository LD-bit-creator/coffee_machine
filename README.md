#Coffee Machine Project ☕️
This project is a Python-based simulation of a coffee machine, designed to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The code models the behavior of a coffee machine, allowing users to select different types of coffee, track ingredient usage, and handle payments.

Features
Encapsulation: All machine operations and data are encapsulated within dedicated classes.
Inheritance: Different coffee types inherit from a base Coffee class.
Polymorphism: Methods are overridden to customize functionality for specific coffee types.
Abstraction: Simplified interfaces are provided for user interaction, hiding complex internal processes.
This project is a great resource for learning and practicing OOP principles in Python, with a practical and engaging example.
